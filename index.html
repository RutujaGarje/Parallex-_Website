        <h1>Our Place in the Universe: From the Milky Way to Earth</h1>
        <p>

            This website takes you on a journey through the cosmos, exploring humanity's place within the vast expanse of the universe.
            <br> Starting with the Milky Way Galaxy, our galactic home among billions of other stars and planets, we gradually narrow down to our solar system, our planet Earth, and finally, the very streets where we live. The Milky Way, a majestic barred spiral galaxy, contains everything we know, from distant stars to our own sun, making it a vital part of our existence in the universe.</p>

            Journeying from the Milky Way to our solar system involves zooming in from the grand scale of our galaxy to the intricate details of a single star system. The Milky Way, a sprawling collection of stars and planets, includes the solar system as a small but significant component. As we narrow our focus, we find the solar system, centered around the Sun, which governs the orbits of eight planets and various smaller celestial bodies within its gravitational reach.</p>

        <h1><b> Solar System and Beyond: From the Sun to Earth</b></h1>
        <p>Our solar system is a vast, dynamic system anchored by the Sun, a medium-sized star that provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. Surrounding the Sun are eight major planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—along with dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Each planet orbits the Sun in a specific path, contributing to the intricate balance and structure of the solar system.
            <br>Zooming in from the solar system to Earth involves focusing on our planet as the third rock from the Sun. Earth is situated in the habitable zone of our solar system, where conditions are just right for liquid water and life. This narrow focus reveals Earth’s unique features, such as its atmosphere, water bodies, and diverse ecosystems that support a rich variety of life forms.
